/* Write a program that asks the user to input a number that represents a year,
   then prints '{year} is a leap year!' or '{year} is NOT a leap year!' after
   checking if the year is leap or not.
   
   Remember that a year is leap if it is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of
   100, or if it is a multiple of 400. */
