/* Write a java program that asks two numbers to the user, one will be the range limit and
   another will be the divisor. Print all the numbers in the range ]divisor, limit] which
   are integer multiples of divisor.
   
   Here is an example:
   
   limit = 20, divisor = 5.
   output: 10, 15, 20
   
   limit = 30, divisor = 7.
   output: 14, 21, 28
